# Train the trainers

Our antifa tech collective is committed to ensuring the highest levels of cybersecurity competence for individuals and initiatives with whom we ally. We will accomplish this goal using the following approach:

1. Identify relevant skills amongst our comrades (the ones who "train")
1. Develop a repeatable process for transferring those skills to a subset of self-selecting, motivated individuals (the "trainers")
1. Support the newly-skilled individuals in further distributing their knowledge/utilizing their skills in the service of their personal communities

Files in this directory are materials for the second and third items, above. These include cybersecurity exercises, demos, and supplemental information (beyond that which can be easily/appropriately added to relevant wiki pages like [InfoSec](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/InfoSec)) generalized to the point that they become a "repeatable process." Also included are generic or templatized material for promoting events or distributing the exercise material.
