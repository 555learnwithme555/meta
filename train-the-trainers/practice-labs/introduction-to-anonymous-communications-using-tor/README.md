# Objectives

When you complete this lab, you will have acquired the following capabilities:

* The ability to proficiently use the Tor Browser to safely perform otherwise risky activites on the Web.
* The ability to detect, diagnose, and circumvent basic censorship activity blocking your access to the Internet.
* The ability to connect to online services that require Tor authentication credentials ("authenticated Onion services").
* The ability to "Torify" arbitrary applications, i.e., to proxy arbitrary applications's network requests through the Tor network.
* The ability to operate a basic Onion service ("Dark Web site") in both unauthenticated (publicly-accessible) and authenticated (more private) modes.

# Bill of materials

This folder contains the following files and folders:

* `README.md` - This file.

# Prerequisites

To perform this lab, you must have:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* An active Internet connection.

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools.

# Practice

We'll begin by ensuring you have successfully completed the [set up](#set-up) steps. This process will also introduce the fundamentals that you need to understand to complete the rest of the exercise.

## Introduction

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Connecting to an authenticated Onion service

> :construction: See [Connecting to an authenticated Onion service](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Connecting-to-an-authenticated-Onion-service) for now.

# Discussion

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Additional Tor Infrastructure: Directory Authorities

> :construction: TK-TODO: Flesh this out a bit more.

In addition to [Tor relays](#understanding-tor-circuits-and-relays), there is an additional type of Tor server needed for the Tor network to function, called a *Directory Authority*. This server is distinct from a Tor relay because its primary purpose is to provide other Tor instances with information they can use to construct a Tor circuit for their own traffic. As a Tor user, you will never need to run your own Directory Authority server, but if you want to create your own Tor network, your network will need at least on Directory Authority that you run yourself.

See [Run your own Tor network](https://ritter.vg/blog-run_your_own_tor_network.html) for more information.
