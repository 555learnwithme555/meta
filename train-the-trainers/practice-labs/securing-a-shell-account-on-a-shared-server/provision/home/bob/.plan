Not entirely sure what I should be doing with my life right now. I am majoring in Computer Science but everything about this study is unexciting and apaprently geared towards making rich white men more money. Something upsets me about this but I can't tell what. It seems useless.

I'm usually at the campus cafeteria looking dejected. You can usually find me sleeping in class during the early morning hours. I know this is not how I'm supposed to get good grades but seeing as how I'm white, cis, and male, I'll get a good job anyway.
