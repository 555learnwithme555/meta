Hi, everyone!

My name is Alice, and I recently returned from a trip to Wonderland. It's a marvelous place that I miss terribly. So many friends!

Now that I'm back, I plan on continuing my work on imagination. I have a book in mind that I think I'd like to write, so you'll probably see me editing my manuscript. When I'm ready to share some of them, I'll place chapters in ~alice/Adventures so you can read them. I would sincerely appreciate your honest feedback.
