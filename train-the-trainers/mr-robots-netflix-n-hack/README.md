# Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack

In this folder, you'll find cybersecurity exercises and suggested demos that you can use to supplement "[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Mr.-Robot%27s-Netflix-%27n%27-Hack)" events. All exercise material added here should be written in a manner that makes it accessible to beginners, even if you feel that the topic of the exercise is "advanced." If you cannot write the exercise so it is accessible to a beginner, you probably do not understand it well enough yourself.

This project is organized in the following way:

* `week-<N>` folder, containing
    * *`<exercise name>`* folder, containing material for each individual exercise or demo, consisting of
        * `README.md` file containing a detailed walkthrough of the exercise or demo, which is at a minimum comprised of the following sections:
            1. `Objectives` - a short list of achievable goals, no more than three or four. (If you are trying to accomplish more than four goals in one exercise, consider the possibility that you would be better off creating two separate exercises.)
            1. `Scenario` - a brief narrative describing the context relevant to the goals.
            1. `Prerequisites` - a (reasonably) thorough accounting of all the required materials or capabilities assumed to be available to the reader.
            1. `Set up` - a (reasonably) exhaustive, step-by-step walkthrough for the exact steps needed to prepare for the exercise.
            1. `Practice` - a detailed guide, written as prose, optimized for positive educational impact and geared to accomplish the goals of the lesson. Omit steps that are intended to be "an exercise for the reader," for obvious reasons.
            1. `Discussion` - supplemental information chunked into logical sections describing additional details related to the exercise or its practice.
            1. `Additional references` - a curated list of named links (not merely raw URLs) that further elucidate the topic, goals, or general subject matter but that are only relevant to particularly interested readers. Avoid including links to references already linked to in prior sections.
