# Recognizing fake websites and phishing scams

In this exercise we will create a fake version of a popular website's login page (a *[phishing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) site*) in order to trick an unsuspecting user into giving us their username and password combination for that website. We will then be able to impersonate that user to the website, gaining access to their account. Our goal is to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious website so that we sensitize ourselves to any red flags or warnings we experience while browsing the Web.

> :beginner: :computer: This exercise requires the use of a command line, or "terminal." If you don't know what that means, or if you do but you feel intimidated by that, consider going through [Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s free, online and self-paced *Foundations: Command Line Basics* course](https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/), spending an hour at [Apple's Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/) (for macOS users), [Ubuntu's Command Line for Beginners tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) (for GNU/Linux users) or reviewing [Computer Hope's article, "How to use the Windows command line (DOS)"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) (for Windows users) if you want to get started quickly. You don't need to complete the whole tutorial or article to understand this exercise, but it will dramatically improve your comprehension of this exercise's mechanics. If you want a more thorough but equally gentle introduction to the same material, consider reading (and listening to) [Taming the Terminal](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/blog/taming-the-terminal/).

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools:

* For creating your phishing website: [Social Engineer's Toolkit (SET)](https://www.trustedsec.com/social-engineer-toolkit-set/), version 8 or newer.
    * While you can install SET on any computer, it is officially supported only on GNU/Linux systems, while macOS and Windows support is experimental. In order to provide a more reliable and consistent experience through this exercise, we will be installing SET into a GNU/Linux virtual machine.
* For managing the virtual machines: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 5.0 or newer, sometimes written as *VBox*.
* For automatically configuring virtual machine settings: [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) version 2.1 or newer.

There are pre-built versions of the VirtualBox hypervisor software for Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, and Solaris available for download from the [VirtualBox downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Your operating system's package repositories may also include a copy of VirtualBox, but be certain to double-check the version available there before installing it to ensure you are using a new-enough version of the software. For [FreeBSD users, VirtualBox is provided as a package or a source port and can be installed by following the instructions in the FreeBSD Handbook, ยง21.6](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/virtualization-host-virtualbox.html).

Similarly, there are pre-built versions of Vagrant for Windows, macOS, and numerous different GNU/Linux flavors available from the [Vagrant downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). [Vagrant is also provided as a FreeBSD port](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/sysutils/vagrant/). Solaris users can [install Vagrant by installing from source](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source.html).

According to [Phishing.org](https://phishing.org), the term "phishing" been in use since approximately 1996:

> "According to Internet records, the first time that the term 'phishing' was used and recorded was on January 2, 1996. The mention occurred in a Usenet newsgroup called AOHell. It is fitting that it was made there too; America Online is where the first rumblings of what would become a major criminal issue would take place."

Since then, it has quickly become one of, if not the single most popular kind of cyber attack. In part, this is because it has become so easy to do over the last two decades. Plus, phishing works primarily on a security vulnerability that is notoriously difficult to patch: human fallibility.

In 2019, according to [Software-As-A-Service provider Retrust](https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html), phishing attempts have grown 65% in the last year, and account for a whopping 90% of all reported data breaches, while 76% of businesses reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the last year.

Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams cost over $12 billion dollars in business losses [according to the FBI](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/fbi-business-email-scam-fraud-phishing/). As for phishing websites, Webroot reports that [nearly 1.5m new phishing sites are created each month](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites).
