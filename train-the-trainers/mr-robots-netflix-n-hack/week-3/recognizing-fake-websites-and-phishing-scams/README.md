# Recognizing fake websites and phishing scams

In this exercise we will create a fake version of a popular email website's login page (a *[phishing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) site*) in order to trick an unsuspecting user into giving us their username and password combination for that website. We will then be able to impersonate that user to the website, gaining access to their account. Our goal is to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious website so that we sensitize ourselves to any red flags or warnings we experience while browsing the Web.
