# Securing your Wi-Fi router from infiltrators

In this exercise, we will remotely take over a standard, off-the-shelf consumer Wi-Fi router, such as those often used in homes, cafés, and local businesses After we have taken control of the router, we will install an after-market system on one of our own routers and reconfigure it in a highly secure manner to immunize ourselves against the same sort of attack(s). Our goal is to understand how to better protect our homes, community establishments, and those networks' users from a variety of malicious attackers as well as how these attackers might target one of the most common electronic devices found in a home: the Wi-Fi router itself.

Essentially, we will be probing for several types of [common wireless network vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_of_wireless_networks) and learn how to configure a small office or home office ("SoHo") Wi-Fi network securely.

# Objectives

When you complete this exercise, you will have acquired the following capabilities:

* The ability to assess whether or not the Wi-Fi network you are using is "safe" or not for you, as its user, particularly useful for "public Wi-Fi networks."
* The ability to probe an arbitrary Wi-Fi network and its controlling device (the router) for basic security holes.
* The ability to "flash" a consumer router, that is, to install and configure an after-market system firmware on it.

# Scenario

> :construction: TK-TODO Some ideas:
> 
> * You are Elliot and you're "intercepting all the traffic on [Ron's Coffeeshop's] network." Might that be better off in Week 1? (But Wi-Fi security doesn't show until Week 6.)
> * You are tracking down an Evil Doer (a, uh, fascist or something?) and have followed them into a café they visit regularly, where they open a laptop. Your challenge: assess the network security and attempt to see their traffic/take over the network to...become their DNS resolver? Something more nefarious?
> * You are a vigilante hacker and have gotten a tip that a certain restaurant is a front for a local KKK chapter (or something). Your challenge: take over the establishment's router and install a backdoor so you can monitor all the goings-on at this place.

# Prerequisites

To participate in this exercise, you must have, at a minimum:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* A consumer Wi-Fi router.

> :beginner: This exercise is written using a [Netgear N300 Wireless Router (WNR2000v4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20161010193356/http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNR2000v4), but most of the early attack steps can be substituted nearly verbatim regardless of the specific router you use. Moreover, specifics that may vary between router makes and models used are marked with a `:beginner:` ( :beginner: ) symbol and discussed at some length so that you can follow along regardless of the device you use.
> 
> :beginner: :warning: You may want to use a spare device rather than your primary or sole home router, since performing some parts of this exercise will disrupt your network activity temporarily or can, in rare circumstances, permanently disable your router.
