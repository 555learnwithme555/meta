# Basic Phishing Website

> :construction: TK-TODO: Write introductory paragraph(s).

According to [Phishing.org](https://phishing.org), the term "phishing" been in use since approximately 1996:

> "According to Internet records, the first time that the term 'phishing' was used and recorded was on January 2, 1996. The mention occurred in a Usenet newsgroup called AOHell. It is fitting that it was made there too; America Online is where the first rumblings of what would become a major criminal issue would take place."

Since then, it has quickly become one of, if not the single most popular kind of cyber attack. In part, this is because it has become so easy to do over the last two decades. Plus, phishing works primarily on a security vulnerability that is notoriously difficult to patch: human fallibility.

In 2019, according to [Software-As-A-Service provider Retrust](https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html), phishing attempts have grown 65% in the last year, and account for a whopping 90% of all reported data breaches, while 76% of businesses reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the last year.

Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams cost over $12 billion dollars in business losses [according to the FBI](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/fbi-business-email-scam-fraud-phishing/). As for phishing websites, Webroot reports that [nearly 1.5m new phishing sites are created each month](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites).
