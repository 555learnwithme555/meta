# Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective / Tech Antifa

Shared assets for various Anarcho-Tech NYC projects live here. :)

> :construction: This is a work in progress, and while that's generally *always* true, it's currently in a particular embryonic state.

This repository is (generally) organized in the following way:

* *`<project name>`*/ folder for a given [meta-organizing project](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/projects)
    * `README.md` file describing the project goals, details, specific structure (if deviating from this general structure)
    * *`<subproject name>`*/ folder housing files related to a particular subproject
        * `README.md` file describing the subproject itself
