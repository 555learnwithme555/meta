# Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective / Tech Antifa

Shared assets for various Anarcho-Tech NYC projects live here. :)

> :construction: This is a work in progress, and while that's generally *always* true, it's currently in a particular embryonic state.

# Repository structure

This repository is (generally) organized in the following way:

* *`<project name>/`* folder for a given [meta-organizing project](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/projects)
    * `README.md` file describing the project goals, details, specific structure (if deviating from this general structure)
    * *`<subproject name>/`* folder housing files related to a particular subproject
        * `README.md` file describing the subproject itself

# Nomenclature

You may encounter the following icons throughout these texts:

* `:beginner:` ( :beginner: ) is used to introduce a reader to concepts they may not already know.
* `:book:` ( :book: ) is used to introduce an aside about a particularly academic, rather than practical, concept, or when providing a narrative distinct from the primary text's narrative.
* `:bulb:` ( :bulb: ) is used to introduce a tip or note about an advanced feature or idea.
* `:cinema:` ( :cinema: ) is used to introduce an aside about the product or production of media.
* `:computer:` ( :computer: ) is used to introduce an aside about computer technology only indirectly relevant to the task at hand.
* `:construction:` ( :construction: ) is used to explicitly mark a section as incomplete, that is, one whose editors do not intend it to be the final or "published" product of their work.
* `:globe_with_meridians:` ( :globe_with_meridians: ) is used to explicitly mark links that go to unaffiliated, remote destinations.
* `:memo:` ( :memo: ) is used to indicate that the following text is intended as a note to fellow editors, rather than intended to be read as part of the normal flow of text by a consumer.
* `:warning:` ( :warning: ) is used to highlight a risky or dangerous activity.

These icons are sometimes used in combination for added meaning. For instance, :beginner::warning: is a "warning for beginners."
